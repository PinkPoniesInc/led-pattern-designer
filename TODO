In general an animation is defined in terms of the following:

- start with whole strip 1 color
- define a pattern of arbitrary length using colors & intensities
- define a position of a pattern over time
- define a blend mode of a pattern with the existing colors
- optionally: allow definition of blend mode over time (to be determined how useful this is)
- once the animation is over, define the state of the led strip as the end result of the blend
- start over
